## 🧠 Problem Format
Each problem solution typically contains:
- Clear problem statement
- Brute force approach
- Optimized approach
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Edge case discussion
- Time Complexity: `O(...)`
- Space Complexity: `O(...)`

Optimized solutions are preferred over brute force.
